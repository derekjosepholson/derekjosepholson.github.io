title: Scribing Versus Conjuring
---

In my first blog post today I will talk about the differences between scribing and conjuring. Scribing is the act of dissecting code and trying to find out how every little thing works. Conjuring is where a higher up approach it taken to try to understand more generally a thing works. Both of these have their own times to be used. It is more important to be a scribe when working on something small and it is a necessity to know every detail. Conjuring is more useful when trying to understand how a whole program is structured. In reality conjuring and scribing are decisions that must be made all the time. If something works and it is not clear why, the decision is wheter to try and find out or just keep moving. This decision can be very hard because it is impossible to know what will give the greatest benefit moving forward. I would suggest to always give the maximum effort to something, but when no progress is made and the end goal doesn't depend on this factor, it may be necessary to sway to the conjuring side of things. Although conjuring should never be an excuse for laziness. I hope this post was informative in the differences between conjuring and scribing and when they are necessary.
