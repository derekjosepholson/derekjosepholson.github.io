title: Using Curl to Test Backend Routes
---

Using curl in the command line allows you to imitate the front-end sending requests to the backend, so you can check if routes are acting as expected. 


-- To imitate a POST request you can use a template similar to this 
<pre><code>curl --data "varName=value&varName2=value2" localhost:8080/route</code></pre>
where the string creates properties that are attached to the request body and multiple properties are seperated by the &. It is important to not use spaces in this long string unless there is a propertiy whose string value should contain a space or spaces. the 
<pre><code>localhost:8080/route </code></pre>
can be replaced with wherever you are running your server. In this case I am making a request to localhost on port 8080 and the path is /route.


-- A GET request that requires the request body to have properties would follow the same template as above. If no properties are needed, the
<pre><code>--data "varName=value"</code></pre> 
 can be omitted. Thus leaving 
 <pre><code>curl localhost:8080/route.</code></pre>

You can use these curl requests to help you find out if you have any issues in your code, and when you do... yes I said when and not if... you can also try and use these requests to pinpoint the bug in your code.
